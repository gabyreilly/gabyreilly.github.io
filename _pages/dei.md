## ERGs at Airship

When I joined Airship, I was thrilled to find a thriving Women's Employee Resource Group. In a tech company with a large engineering organization, it was easy to feel isolated; I was the only woman on my team, and often the only woman in the room during meetings. The ERG helped me connect with my coworkers across the company.

The ERG was completely managed by volunteers who rotated every few months.  After an inspiring conference at [ACT-W](https://national.act-w.org/conference/), I volunteered to lead the group, with a few changes.

I felt that the mission of the ERG could be expanded to include anyone who "brings their gender to work", so when I became the group leader I explicitly included non-binary and trans employees in our mission statement. I also established a rotating 1-on-1 program and Community Guidelines for our slack channel.

The content I shared with the group is copied below.  I hope it helps anyone else who is forming an ERG.

### Airship-FM : Fighting Misogyny

The focus of airship-fm is Airship employees who are women (including trans women), non-binary, trans men, or who have other gender identities & expression. 


Misogyny affects us all no matter how we identify or express our gender. Company culture should include us all, but we aren't always represented.
