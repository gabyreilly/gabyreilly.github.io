webhooks-alt: "Webhooks are a common way to integrate with other systems & glue everything together over the internet.

The main idea:
When an event happens in a system
Then something else should happen in other systems

Usually, webhooks are used by a company to provide events to their customers

Lets say: When the cat meows, we want to put food in her bowl.
We have a microphone and a bowl, both connected to the internet.

The meow is the event, the microphone is the sender, and the bowl is the recipient

Microphone sends info to bowl over HTTP

{
  “event” : {
    “type” : “meow”,
    “decibels” 40 
  }
}

Then the bowl decides what to do

if event.decibels > 30:
  fish

I am a backend engineer - I write Java
I play lots of dungeons and dragons!
Tech is my second career
I broke my ankle in 2018 & still healing
I am bossy!

Likes:

When stressed, I make lots of lists!

Dreams and goals:
Leading tech teams as an engineer
Busy social & gaming life
International travel

(Yes, I am living the dream!)

For casual discussions, let's use team slack.

For conflicts and in-depth designs, a scheduled meeting works better.

When we make decisions or learn something new, I will probably document it!

## Mockito Workshop

Unit testing is an important step of software development, especially when a program will evolve and change over time. In this hands-on workshop, we will write unit tests for a small Java program using JUnit and Mockito. We will discuss how to make a program "testable", how to use mocks and assertions, and share tips for debugging. This workshop is appropriate for any developer interested in unit testing, and especially those comfortable with Java concepts.
